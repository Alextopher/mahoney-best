## The Short-Story

I'm a life-long learner with a focus on software engineering but with interests that spread across all STEM fields. In addition to software I like astronomy, aerospace, and physics the most. I graduated from [Clarkson University](https://clarkson.edu) in December 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Science.

I also have a passion for teaching and mentoring. At the moment I'm a Teaching Assistant at [Tech Valley High School](https://techvalleyhigh.org) (TVHS). I was planning on transitioning into education but I've decided to take another crack at tech.

Working at TVHS has been great, I've gotten better at communicating and collaborating through the process. TVHS is also my home, I graduated from there in 2019 and I've felt like I've been able to give back to a place that influenced my life profoundly. Part of my impact at TVHS is how I've been able to give many students a lens into the world of Computer Science that they may not have gotten otherwise. At Tech Valley I've been [critical](/m/robotopia.md) to the workings of the school's [FIRST](https://www.firstinspires.org/) robotics team.

[FRC 5881](https://tvhsfrc.org/) is TVHS's FIRST Robotics Competition team. I'm a team Alumnus and mentor. I wear many hats on the robotics team. On paper I'm the "programming mentor", in practice I take on a much wider role across the robot and in team leadership.

While I like teaching I've found I really like learning more. I'm looking for a new challenge where I can sustainably grow my skills and knowledge and contribute to a team.
