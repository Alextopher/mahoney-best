I'm Chris Mahoney, aka `alextopher` online and this is my handwritten personal website.

- This front-page is my portfolio / blog
- I'm (very slowly) working on my FIRST Robotics Competetion curriculum
- Behind the scenes I'm building a few useful tools for my personal use

I intend to migrate these tools into this project.

## The Short-Story

I'm a life-long learner with a focus on software engineering but with interests that spread across all STEM fields. In addition to software I like astronomy and physics. I graduated from [Clarkson University](https://clarkson.edu) in December 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Science. From there I worked for a short time a mid sized software shop where, for a number of personal reasons, I did not succeed. That shock sent me for a short time down the path of becoming an educator. I worked as a teaching assistant and subsitute at my former high school totaling around 2 years. Today, I've leveled out and rediscovered my value as a software engineer and work for IBM Research at the Albany NanoTech Complex.
