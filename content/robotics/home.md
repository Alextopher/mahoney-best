# FRC Programming

Welcome to FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) programming! I'm very excited to work together with you. FIRST is not just about building robots, it's about building ourselves and recognizing the impact of science and technology. FRC programming requires a lot of teamwork. Teamwork between disciplines, between students, and between mentors.

Before getting started, I want to set norms for our work together. In my opinion there are 4 pillars of FRC programming.

1. [Java](/content/robotics/java.md)
2. [Command Based Programming](/content/robotics/commands.md) (Abstraction)
3. Control Theory (Math)
4. FRC Ecosystem

Generally speaking, this is the order of topics you should focus on. As a student you have big reasons to learn Java and Abstraction. Java shows up in the AP Computer Science exam, is popular in it's own right, and simply learning any programming language at all is a great idea. Furthermore, Abstraction is the most important concept in Computer Science.

As a mentor I will focus on bringing you up to speed in Control Theory and will make sure that we have the right tools and equipment to succeed, but as I cover in the [Java](/content/robotics/java.md) section I unfortunately can't teach you Java to the level we could in a classroom setting. I'm not here to hide anything from you, feel free to make [cheifdelphi](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/) your homepage or read a Control Theory [textbook](https://file.tavsys.net/control/controls-engineering-in-frc.pdf), but your agency is most well spent on learning Java.

## 4 years of FRC

FRC covers all 4 years of high-school. As you progress through the years you will naturally take on more responsibility and learn more advanced topics. This isn't a hard and fast rule but generally this I how I imagine your progression on the team:

| Year | Focus |
|:-----|:------|
| **1st** | Most student's don't enter FRC with enough Robotics and Programming experience to shine on programming team. Personally, I joined the team with farly extensive programming experience for my age and I didn't join the programming team until my second year. You should focus your first year on getting to know the team and having fun. |
| **Off Season** | Before entering your Sophomore year it would be ideal if you started programming on your own and got some serious Java experience. Check the [Java](/content/robotics/java.md) page for recommendations |
| **2nd** | Now that you're comfortable with the team and have some Java experience you can start writing code for the robot. You'll be apart of programming discussions and will have opportunities to contribute to the robot code. I'll also start introducing the FRC Ecosystem and Control Theory. |
| **Off Season** | Going into your Junior year we run a solo robot simulation project. This project is all about building the right abstractions and identifying the right control theory principles to solve a previous year's game. The goal is to build confidence in your ability to program a robot, all on your own. |
| **3rd**| Starting your Junior year you can have a profound impact in the direction of the robot. With a solid understanding of Java and abstraction you can simply just look at a robot and get a sense of all of the Subsystems and Commands needed to make it work. In addition to writing code you should consider taking more of a leadership role in one of the 4 pillars. Consider learning advanced Java concepts, becoming a master of abstraction, diving deeper into controls, or take a more active role in the FRC Ecosystem. |
| **Off Season** | Self directed project. Ideally you help build something that pushes the team forward for the benefit of future generations. |
| **4th** | A senior's role on the team is more self-directed. Continue programming as you see fit. I encourage you to take on more of a leadership role in the team. Try to have in impact with our wider community and start looking forward. |

It's perfectly fine to take a break or start late. FIRST isn't about "being on track" it's about pushing yourself, wherever you are right now, to discover.
