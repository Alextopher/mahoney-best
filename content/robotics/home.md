# FRC Programming Curriculum

> ⚠️ _WORK IN PROGRESS_ ⚠️

I'm developing a bit of an informal curriculum for teaching programming to students. It's mostly made of up self contained workshops that I'm able to run at moments notice, those all exist in my brain and might never be written down. I want to build up to something I'd be comfortable sharing with other mentors.

Generally there are 4 main topics I cover:

## Java

The language we use to write the robot's code, and it's something I don't have enough time to teach. Really, AP Computer Science is the right level to be proficient enough to write FRC code on your own. That's a year long course and generally only available to Seniors on my team. So, I try to share resources they can use to learn the basics of Java on their own time, and I help them with their journey. I typically do 1-on-1 workshops with students when they need more programming help.

## Control Theory

The math behind how we make the robot move. I cover Kinematics, Feedback Control (reinventing PID), Feed-forward Control, System Identification, and Motion Profiling.

I adapt the material to the particular group of students I'm working with, but generally I've simplified the material down to Algebra 1 and basic Trigonometry. I think PID is a great way to "discover" Calculus in a natural way.

The way I handle Control Theory is through 1 or 2 intense lectures. I don't ask students to memorize any of the material. My goal is that when we reach a problem that requires Control Theory I'll be able to just hand them the answer and they would have seen it before.

## Command Based Programming

Command Based Programming is the WPILib framework we use to structure our robot code. It's all about creating abstractions for the robot's subsystems and building commands to control them. Command Based Programming is really just a great way to teach Object Oriented Programming and composition.

I want to grow this the audience for this topic. I think all students, even the more mechanically inclined, could benefit from seeing a software engineer's perspective on subsystem and commands.

## FRC Ecosystem

An understanding the FRC ecosystem including vendor libraries and WPILib. Generally this can only come with experience and it also requires keeping up with the latest tools and techniques. I try to keep up with the latest tools and techniques and serve as a encyclopedia for the team.
