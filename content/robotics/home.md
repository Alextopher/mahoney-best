# FRC Programming

Welcome to FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) programming! I'm very excited to work together with you. FIRST is not just about building robots, it's about building ourselves and recognizing the impact of science and technology. FRC programming requires a lot of teamwork. Teamwork between disciplines, between students, and between mentors.

Before getting started, I want to set norms for our work together. In my opinion there are 4 pillars of FRC programming. These are:

1. [Java](/content/robotics/java.md)
2. [Command Based Programming](/content/robotics/commands.md) (Abstraction)
3. Control Theory (Math)
4. FRC Ecosystem

Generally speaking, this is the order of topics you should focus on. I have a competitive advantage in learning about the FRC Ecosystem and Control Theory as those topics take a lot of time master. It's a simple fact that I've been programming for a long time, and I've been doing FRC for much longer than any student has.

As a student you have big reasons to learn Java and Abstraction. Java shows up in the AP Computer Science exam, is popular in it's own right, and simply learning any programming language at all is a good idea. Furthermore Abstraction is the most important concept in computer science and in problem solving in general.

**You should focus on learning Java and becoming a better programmer**. I will focus on bringing you up to speed in Control Theory and will make sure that we have the right tools and equipment to succeed. I'm not here to hide anything from you, feel free to make [cheifdelphi](https://www.chiefdelphi.com/) your homepage or read a Control Theory [textbook](https://file.tavsys.net/control/controls-engineering-in-frc.pdf). Just know that you don't need to do those things to be successful in FRC.

Your time is best spent learning skills that will be useful to you later in life.

## 4 years of FRC

FRC covers all 4 years of high-school. As you progress through the years you will naturally take on more responsibility and learn more advanced topics. This isn't a hard and fast rule but generally this I how I imagine your progression on the team:

| Year | Focus |
|:-----|:------|
| **1st** | Getting familiar with the robot and the team. Unless if you're entering with substantial Java experience you're unlikely to be contributing to the robot code. **You should focus on having fun and determining if programming is right fit for you.** |
| **Off Season** | Before entering your Sophomore year it would be ideal if you started programming on your own and got somewhere around 100 hours of Java experience. Fluency in Java is a prerequisite for writing robot code. |
| **2nd** | Now that you're comfortable with the team and have some Java experience you can start writing code for the robot. You'll be apart of programming discussion and will have opportunities to contribute to the robot code. I'll also start introducing to the FRC Ecosystem and Control Theory. |
| **Off Season** | Going into your Junior year I run a robot simulation project. This project is all about building the right abstractions and identifying the right control theory principles to solve a previous year's game. The goal is to build confidence in your ability to program a robot, all on your own. |
| **3rd**| Starting your Junior year you can have a profound impact in the direction of the robot. With a solid understanding of Java and abstraction you can simply just look at a robot and get a sense of all of the Subsystems and Commands needed to make it work. In addition to writing code you should consider taking more of a leadership role in one of the 4 pillars. Consider learning advanced Java concepts, becoming a master of abstraction, diving deeper into controls, or learning more about the FRC Ecosystem. |
| **Off Season** | Self directed project. Ideally you help build something that pushes the team forward for the benefit of all future generations. |
| **4th** | A senior's role on the team is more self-directed. Continue programming as you see fit. I encourage you to take on more of a leadership role in the team, and try to have in impact with our wider community. |

It's perfectly fine to take a break or start late. FIRST isn't about "being on track" it's about pushing yourself, wherever you are right now, to discover and innovate. I'm more than happy to get Juniors and Seniors learning Java or give Freshman and Sophomores opportunities to lead. Nothing here is one size fits all.
