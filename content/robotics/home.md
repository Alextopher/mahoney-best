# FRC Programming Curriculum

> ⚠️ _WORK IN PROGRESS_ ⚠️

Right now I've got an informal FRC programming curriculum that I rely on. The trouble is, that it's all in my head. These pages are an attempt to get these lessons out of my head and into a form that can be shared with others.

Generally there are 4 main topics I cover:

## Java

The language we use to write the robot's code, and it's something I don't have enough time to teach fully. I think AP Computer Science is the right level to be proficient enough to write FRC code on your own. That's a year long course and generally only available to Seniors on my team. So, I try to share resources they can use to learn the basics of Java on their own time, and I help them with their journey. I typically do 1-on-1 workshops with students when they need more programming help.

## Control Theory

The math behind how we make the robot move. I cover Kinematics, Feedback Control (reinventing PID), Feed-forward Control, System Identification, and Motion Profiling.

I adapt the material to the particular group of students I'm working with, but generally I've simplified the material down to Algebra 1 and basic Trigonometry (sin, cosine, and tan). During the season I'll often hint at the existence of Calculus because I think PID is a great way to "discover" Calculus in a natural way.

The way I handle Control Theory is through 1 or 2 intense lectures. I don't ask students to memorize any of the material. My goal is that when we reach a problem that requires Control Theory I'll be able to just hand over the answer and they would have seen it before. With some repetition I hope that upperclassmen will grow to be able to solve these problems on their own.

## Command Based Programming

Command Based Programming is the WPILib framework we use to structure our robot code. It's all about creating abstractions for the robot's subsystems and building commands to control them. Command Based Programming is really such a great way to teach Object Oriented Programming and composition.

I want to grow this the audience for this topic. I think all students, even the more mechanically inclined, could benefit from seeing a software engineer's perspective on subsystem and commands.

## FRC Ecosystem

An understanding the FRC ecosystem including vendor libraries and WPILib. Generally this can only come with experience and it also requires keeping up with the latest tools and techniques. I try to keep up with the latest tools and techniques and serve as a encyclopedia for the team.
