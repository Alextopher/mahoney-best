## The Short-Story

I'm a life-long learner with a focus on computer science but with interests that spread across all STEM fields. I particularly like astronomy, space, and physics. I graduated from [Clarkson University](https://clarkson.edu) in December 2022 with a B.S. in Computer Science.

I've got a passion for teaching and mentoring. At the moment I'm a Teaching Assistant at [Tech Valley High School](https://techvalleyhigh.org) (TVHS). Originally, I was planning on fully transitioning into education but I've decided to take another crack at software development.

Working at TVHS has been great, I've gotten better at communicating and collaborating through the process. TVHS is also my home, I graduated from there in 2019 and I've felt like I've been able to give back to a place that really influenced my life profoundly. Part of that is I've given many students a lens into the world of Computer Science that they likely would not have gotten otherwise. I've also been critical in the operation of the school's [FIRST](https://www.firstinspires.org/) robotics team.

While I like teaching I've found I really like learning more. I'm looking for a new challenge where I can sustainably grow my skills and knowledge and contribute to a team.
