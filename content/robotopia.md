# Robotics

This page is about my personal involvement in FIRST.

## Student Experience

I joined [FIRST](https://firstinspires.org) in Fall 2015 as a student on [FRC 5881](https://tvhsfrc.org/). As a student I was the team's lead programmer, responsible for the robot's software and controls. I also picked up a lot of skills in electronics and the principals of the engineering design process. My physics background helped me model the robot's behavior and reason about design problems in a unique way.

As an upperclassman I took on more of a leadership/mentor role on the team. I took active roles in engaging with new students and I would do workshops teaching peers some of the skills they needed to be successful on the team. I often had a hand in leading team meetings, primarily focusing on making sure everyone had a task for the day. The soft skills I learned on 5881 have been just as important as the technical skills.

I graduated from high school in 2019 and went on to study Computer Science, in part because of my experiences on the team. One of the most valuable impacts from FIRST was the oppertunity to work with talented adults. As a confident and talented student I never had any issue convincing my peers to follow my lead, but the oppertunity to convince _adults_ into believing my ideas was a unique experience I would never have had otherwise.

## University

At university I only really volunteered for some [Clarkson](https://www.clarkson.edu/) run robotics events. Many of which were cancelled by the pandemic. I did a little bit of other work like summer tech camps for middle schoolers and volunteered in other STEM outreach events representing my acedmic club.

I have some advice for upcoming FIRST alumni who are starting their adult lives.

1. **Take a break**
  - Around 25% of students drop out in their first year at university and plenty of people fail out of their first job.
  - While it might not feel like it in March, there's much more to life than robotics.
  - Build something new in your life. Acedemic organizations are a great place to start.
2. **Under no circumstances mentor your old team**
  - Mentoring students who intersected with you in high school is a massive conflict of interest.
  - Your teachers will still consider you a student.
  - As per the FIRST code of conduct as a mentor you **cannot be personal friends with your students**.
  - Even if you think that you can navigate these minefields others may not see it that way.
3. **Volunteer at events**
  - FLL, FTC, and FRC events are impossible to run without volunteers, many of whom are students & alumni.
  - Go be field reset at FRC or a judge at a FIRST Lego Challenge event, it's a ton of fun!
  - Events are also perfect for college students. You meet new people, your commitment is only for a weekend, and you help make the world a better place.
4. **Prefer K-8 programs**
  - If you still wish to take a larger role try to stick to working with K-8 programs.
  - A 19 year old can fairly easily mentor a 14 year old but a 19 year old mentoring a 17 year old is a harder sell.
  - There's tons of programs for under 10s and over 14s but very few for 10-14. You could have a much larger impact helping more students, especially girls, cross that gap.

## Mentoring

I've been mentoring my old team since Spring 2023, after returning home from university.

In 2023 I was solely focused on the programming & electronics side of the team. 2023 was a rebuild season for me. I'd become a much stronger programmer and engineer but I needed time to re-integrate into the FRC ecosystem and learn the new tools and techniques that had been developed since I left. A big part of my season was studying Control Theory. I highly recommend reading [_Controls Engineering in the FIRST Robotics Competition_](https://file.tavsys.net/control/controls-engineering-in-frc.pdf) by Tyler Veness if you want to get better at FRC controls. Today, I like to think that there's no bit of FRC programming that's out of reach for my team. The goal for the next few years is growing my team's expertise so we're be able to tackle challenges quickly.

In 2024 our lead mentor left the team. In response I've taken on a much larger role in the team's leadership. Adding to my programming/electronics role I've been taking on over-all team management, serving as the glue that holds the team together. I've also found myself also helping the design side of the team, I'm not all that great at CAD or mechanical design but I'm able to bring physics and engineering design principles to them.

I've also created and now maintain/host the [team's website](https://tvhsfrc.org), [source code](https://github.com/FRC5881/web).

### Other Teams

Other than being a mentor on 5881 I've also opened myself up to assisting other teams.

| Team                      | Year | Assistance |
|:--------------------------|:-----|:-----------|
| [FRC 7718](https://www.team7718.com/) - _HPVA Dragons_ | 2024 | The HPVA teams at Ulster BOCES have an extremely strong design and manufacturing program, but are weaker in programming and controls. During the FRC Crescendo season I made a day trip to their school. I got them setup with their Swerve Drive, and gave them a crash course in Control Theory and WPILib Command-Based Programming architecture. I provided further support online and in person at NYTV Regional. |

## Volunteering

Once I'm able to afford my travel my goal is to become a Controls Systems Advisor (CSA) at FRC events. CSAs can often make or break a team's competition experience. I've found myself serving in that role informally at my team's events, but I'd like to take on that role formally.

### Event History

Here's a history of my volunteering at FIRST events.
