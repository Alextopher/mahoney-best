# Robotics

This page is about my involvement in FIRST. If you're looking for more technical information or my informal curriculum go [here](/m/robotics/home.md).

## Student Experience

I joined [FIRST](https://firstinspires.org) in Fall 2015 as a student on [FRC 5881](https://tvhsfrc.org/). As a student I was the team's lead programmer, responsible for the robot's software and controls. I also picked up a lot of skills in electronics and mechanical design. My physics background helped me model the robot's behavior and solve design problems.

As an upperclassman I took on more of a leadership/mentor role on the team. I took active roles in engaging with new students and I would do workshops teaching peers some of the skills they needed to be successful on the team. I often had a hand in leading team meetings, primarily focusing on making sure everyone had a task for the day. The soft skills I learned on 5881 have been just as important as the technical skills.

I graduated from TVHS in 2019 and went on to study Computer Science, in part because of my experiences on the team.

## Mentoring

I've been mentoring my old team since Spring 2023, after returning home from university.

In 2023 I was solely focused on the programming/electronics side of the team. 2023 was a rebuild season for me. I'd become a much stronger programmer but I needed time to re-integrate into the FRC ecosystem and learn the new tools and techniques that had been developed since I left. A big part of that was covering Control Theory and I highly recommend [_Controls Engineering in the
FIRST Robotics Competition_](https://file.tavsys.net/control/controls-engineering-in-frc.pdf) by Tyler Veness for that. Today I like to think that there's no bit of FRC programming that's out of reach for my team. The goal for the next few years is growing my team's expertise so we're be able to tackle challenges quickly.

In 2024 our lead mentor left the team. In response I've taken on a much larger role in the team's leadership. Adding to my programming/electronics role I've been taking on over-all team management, serving as the glue that holds the team together. This year I was the mentor that planed meetings and structured the season.

### Other Teams

Other than being a mentor on 5881 I've also opened myself up to assisting other teams. I'm part of an informal mentor network but I'm looking to join the official FIRST Mentor Network.

| Team                      | Year | Assistance |
|:--------------------------|:-----|:-----------|
| FRC 7718 - _HPVA Dragons_ | 2024 | The HPVA teams at Ulster BOCES have an extremely strong design and manufacturing program, but are weaker in programming and controls. During the FRC Crescendo season I made a day trip to their school. I got them setup with their Swerve Drive, and gave them a crash course in Control Theory and WPILib Command-Based Programming architecture. I provided further support online and in person at NY-Tech Valley Regional |

## Volunteering

My long term volunteering goal is to become a Controls Systems Advisor (CSA) at FRC events. CSA's can often make or break a team's competition experience. I've found myself serving in that role informally at my team's events and I'd like to make that a more formal role.

I'm working towards that goal by further familiarizing myself with the FRC ecosystem. In order to continue on that path I need to begin volunteering at more events, which requires a lot of travel I can't do right now.
